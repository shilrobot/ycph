RUNNING IN WINDOWED MODE:
=========================
I didn't really make a nice config system for this; but,
if you really want to run windowed mode, make a file called
"config.py" and put the following line in it:

fullscreen = 0

Then take that file and add it to library.zip. This will replace
the built-in configuration module and will run the game
in windowed mode.

If you want to change this, either remove the .py file from
library.zip or just replace it with a file that says

fullscreen = 1

(As might be expected.)

CHANGES:
========
0.4
* Mixed audio tracks to 220500 Hz Mono OGGs, saved a lot of space,
  and should run fine if you're using the source on a non-Windows
  system and don't have an MP3 decoder
* Compressed as RAR (better ratio than .zip)
* Added windowed mode trick
